        For EndNote, you must have exported your library from EndNote using the BiBler Export style provided in the external/ folder of the BiBler distribution.
        For CSV, the data must be formatted in the same way as the export does.</dd>

        <dd>Search through the list of entries and display only those that satisfy the query provided. This searches through all values, not field names and entry types. The query is not case-sensitive and special characters are simplified (e.g., 'e' will match &eacute;). By default, an exact match of the query must be found. Regular expressions can be used if the option is enabled in the preferences. The supported regular expressions follow <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/re.html">Python regex</a>.</dd>

                <li><b>Allow non-standard fields</b><br/>
                Allow to retain non-standard <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/bibliographic/bibtex-defs.html">BibTeX fields</a> in each entry. This is enabled by default. Otherwise, those fields will be removed from the entries.</li>
                
                <li><b>Override key generation</b><br/>

                <li><b>Search query as regular expression</b><br/>
                When enabled, you can specify regular expressions in the search. This is disabled by default.</li>

    <h2>List of entries</h2>
    <a name="list"></a>
    <p>
        All entries added or loaded from a file are displayed as a table. The list displays minimal information to identify each entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on a column will sort all entries currently displayed in increasing alpha-numerical order. Columns can be resized, by moving to their header's edge, and can be reordered by drag-n-drop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Entries in white are correct and valid. Entries in red are either missing a mandatory field or have an error in one of them. Entries in light color have a minor error. When you click on a colored entry, the corresponding error is displayed at the bootom of the window. Note that an entry may have more than one error.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a paper is linked to an entry, a small PDF icon appears on the left of the of the row of the corresponding entry. Double-click on the row to open the file.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Editing an entry</h2>
    <a name="update"></a>
    <p>
        When an entry is selected from the list, its content is displayed at the bottom left of the window. Currently, entries can only be edited in their BibTeX format. BibTeX entries must be specified in a valid syntax. When you are done modifying the text, click on Update to apply the changes to the entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The general format of a BibTeX entry is:
<pre>@ENTRYTYPE{key,
  field1 = {value1},
  field2 = {value2}
}
</pre>
        
        White spaces are ignored. You can use curly brackets <code>{ }</code> or double quotes <code>" "</code> for values. If you do not provide a key, make sure the following comma is there.
        Here is an example of an article appearing in a journal or magazine:
<pre>@ARTICLE{article,
  author = {Lastname1, Firstname1 and Lastname2, Firstname2},
  journal = {The name of the journal},
  title = {The title of the work},
  year = {1993},
  month = {aug},
  note = {An optional note},
  number = {2},
  pages = {201--213},
  volume = {4}
}
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Click on the following link to see some <a href="https://verbosus.com/bibtex-style-examples.html">BibTeX examples</a>. However, note that some of their fields have values not specified between curly brackets or double quotes, which is invalid.
